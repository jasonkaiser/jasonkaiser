# 👋 Hi, I'm Jason

I'm a **Software Developer & UI Designer** focused on building real-world web applications with clean architecture, strong UX, and scalable backend systems.

I enjoy working across the full stack — from designing interfaces in Figma to implementing secure APIs and connecting everything into a working product.

I also enjoy **helping other students with coding at university** and believe that building strong fundamentals and sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to grow as an engineer.
